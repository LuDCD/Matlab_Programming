%Bob Gess, June 2008, for EE473
%Module name:  testing
%Simulates generation and transmission of a direct sequence spread spectrum
%modulation of a QPSK signal, injects random and/or jamming noise into the
%transmission path, and demodulates the received signal.  Total bit errors
%and bit error rate is output in the command window at the end of the run.

%The program also generates and demodulates a QPSK signal (with random
%noise and/or jamming) in order to compare DSSS performance to QPSK
%performance.

%Because of computer limitations, the sample rate was limited to 80,000
%samples per second (which winds up at 40,000 samples per second when data 
%is split into I and Q channels.  The PRN sequence rate is modifiable, but 
%should be set to 20,000 bps or less.  The data rate was originally  
%designed to runat 2000 bps, but the ratio between spreading signal and 
%data can be increased by decreasing the data rate (N).

%Serial to parallel takes a serial data stream and splits it into I and Q
%channels.

%Prnseq generates a separate PRN sequence for each channel.

%Spreader combines the data and the PRN sequence to create a stream of
%spread symbols.

%qpsk modulates the spread data onto the carrier signal.  It also generates
%a non-spread qpsk signal for comparison purposes.

%Noise generates both random noise and a BPSK jamming signal.  Modify
%amplitude for each in the noise module.  Set amplitude very low for one
%type or both if only one type of interference is desired or if no
%interference is desired.  

%demod demodulates the non-spread signal, converts the data into a single
%serial data stream, and outputs the total bit errors and bit error rate in
%the command window.

%despread demodulates the spread signal, converts the data into a single
%serial data stream, and outputs the total bit errors and bit error rate in
%the command window.

%downlink allows skipping the generation of the transmitted signals and
%focuses solely on the downlink portion.  This saves a considerable amount
%of time for simulations since the for/next loops used in generating the
%PRN sequences are skipped.
